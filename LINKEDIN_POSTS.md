**Special Thanks:**
A huge shoutout to **Claude Code** by Anthropic - an incredibly useful tool throughout this journey. It helped me spot issues I overlooked, debug countless bugs, and think through complex problems. From tricky WebSocket issues to authentication edge cases, having Claude Code as a development partner made this project smoother and taught me better debugging practices. Highly recommend it for any developer! 🙏

**What's Next?**
Voice messages, end-to-end encryption, or video calls - the foundation is ready for anything!

Thank you to everyone who followed along. This project represents my growth as a developer and my readiness for a junior developer role.

The code is clean. The app works. I'm ready for the next challenge! 🚀
